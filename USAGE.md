Download the release attached to a release, then unzip it.

## Linux

Open a terminal where you unzipped the files, and create a virtual environment with `python3 -m venv .venv` and `.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt`. To run PYThing, run `.venv/bin/python3 src/init.py`.

## Windows

Make sure you have python 3 installed. Open the resulting folder from what you unzipped, then run `init.bat`.
